    "text": "Anatomopathology\nAnatomopathology is a medical specialty dedicated to the morphological study of abnormalities in biological tissues. The analysis of these tissues is a critical step for many diagnoses particularly in oncology where it serves as the gold standard (the reference clinical routine). Tissue samples are typically collected during surgery or biopsy . After preprocessing by expert technicians, pathologists examine the samples under a microscope to evaluate biomarkers such as tumor type, cancer stage, etc."

    "text": "PIK3CA Mutation in Breast Cancer\nRecent scientific studies have also shown that histopathology slides contain information underlying the tumor’s genotype . These slides could therefore be used to predict genomic alterations such as point mutations . One such alteration is the PIK3CA mutation in breast cancer.\nThis mutation is observed in approximately 30-40% of breast cancers, most commonly in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) cancers . PIK3CA mutations have been associated with good prognoses. More importantly patients carrying this mutation, who are resistant to endocrine therapy, may respond to a targeted therapy class—PI3Kα inhibitors."

    "text": "Objective of the Challenge\nThe current method for identifying PIK3CA mutations is DNA sequencing which requires technical and bioinformatics expertise that is not accessible in all laboratories.\nAn automated solution for detecting the PIK3CA mutation is clinically relevant as it could provide a fast and reliable screening tool, allowing more patients—especially in tertiary centers-to be eligible for personalized therapies leading to better outcomes.\nThe Owkin challenge is a weakly supervised binary classification problem: the goal is to predict, from a high-resolution digitized histological slide, whether a patient carries a PIK3CA gene mutation."

    "section": "Weakly Supervised Learning in Digital Pathology",
    "text": "Weakly Supervised Learning in Digital Pathology\nWeakly supervised learning is crucial in digital pathology due to the extremely large size of digitized histology slides (&gt; 100,000 × 100,000 pixels). In their raw form, these slides cannot be directly processed by machine learning algorithms.\nTo address this, each slide is divided into smaller images (called tiles) of 224 × 224 pixels 112 µm²). Since a slide is labeled only at the global level (mutation present or absent), and is split into many tiles, the learning methods used must intelligently aggregate these tiles to produce a global label.\nThese methods fall within the field of multiple-instance learning (MIL). Specifically:\n\nIf at least one tile contains a mutation-associated pattern, the algorithm should predict mutation presence.\nIf none of the tiles show such patterns, the algorithm should predict mutation absence.\n\nWhile weak supervision may introduce noise (some tiles contain no useful information for predicting the global label), it eliminates the need for manual annotation of histology slides by pathologists—a costly and time-consuming task."

My participation focused mainly on the analysis of 16S metagenomic data ranging from cleaning, improvement and descriptive analysis to diversity analysis and inference of microbial networks (more information about my work is available in the dedicated project page).\nI then joined the Bilille platform (Bioinformatics, biostatistics and bioanalysis) within the UAR 2014 - US 41 PLBS unit at the University of Lille, working under an RHU-funded research program focused on neurodegenerative diseases. My primary objective is to identify biomarkers for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)."
