The analysis of these tissues is a critical step for many diagnoses particularly in oncology where it serves as the gold standard (the reference clinical routine). Tissue samples are typically collected during surgery or biopsy . After preprocessing by expert technicians, pathologists examine the samples under a microscope to evaluate biomarkers such as tumor type, cancer stage, etc."

    "text": "PIK3CA Mutation in Breast Cancer\nRecent scientific studies have also shown that histopathology slides contain information underlying the tumor’s genotype . These slides could therefore be used to predict genomic alterations such as point mutations . One such alteration is the PIK3CA mutation in breast cancer.\nThis mutation is observed in approximately 30-40% of breast cancers, most commonly in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) cancers . PIK3CA mutations have been associated with good prognoses. More importantly patients carrying this mutation, who are resistant to endocrine therapy, may respond to a targeted therapy class—PI3Kα inhibitors."

    "section": "Weakly Supervised Learning in Digital Pathology",
    "text": "Weakly Supervised Learning in Digital Pathology\nWeakly supervised learning is crucial in digital pathology due to the extremely large size of digitized histology slides (&gt; 100,000 × 100,000 pixels). In their raw form, these slides cannot be directly processed by machine learning algorithms.\nTo address this, each slide is divided into smaller images (called tiles) of 224 × 224 pixels 112 µm²). Since a slide is labeled only at the global level (mutation present or absent), and is split into many tiles, the learning methods used must intelligently aggregate these tiles to produce a global label.\nThese methods fall within the field of multiple-instance learning (MIL). Specifically:\n\nIf at least one tile contains a mutation-associated pattern, the algorithm should predict mutation presence.\nIf none of the tiles show such patterns, the algorithm should predict mutation absence.\n\nWhile weak supervision may introduce noise (some tiles contain no useful information for predicting the global label), it eliminates the need for manual annotation of histology slides by pathologists—a costly and time-consuming task."

    "text": "Context of my contribution\nMy contribution to this project took place in two phases over the course of 2024. From April to September, I worked on it as part of my final-year internship. Then, from October to December, I continued working on the same project—starting from the beginning again—to obtain more robust results for potential publication.\nUnfortunately, as my contract ended before the writing phase of the paper began, I had to leave some aspects of the work partially unfinished.\nHowever, the details of my accomplishments can be found in two Quarto blogs:\n\nInternship Open16s project (completed during my internship)\nINRAE Open16S (completed during my three-month contract)\n\nOf course, the second blog reboot all my previous work so if you want to check only one, feel free to go with INRAE Open16S\n\n\n\nOpen16S project\nINRAE has been a pioneer in open science and established a dedicated department for this domain in 2020.\nThe Open16S project, led by the MICA department at INRAE, is an innovative proof-of-concept (POC) initiative developed as part of the department’s policy. Its goal is to address challenges related to the reuse of public data in metagenomics, particularly to generate new, testable biological hypotheses through the integration of datasets.\nThe primary objective of the project is to take a cross-disciplinary approach to microbial ecosystems associated with the human food chain by utilizing 16S metagenomic datasets from various biotopes.\nThis project involves 12 research units from the MICA department, covering a complete range of targeted ecosystems, including food, digesters, human gut samples, and animal samples (specifically cow teat microbiomes).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear of Submission\n2022\n\n\nTeams Involved\nBibliome\nMigale\nStatInfOmics\n\n\nCoordinators\nStéphane Chaillou, Marie Champomier Vergès, Hélène Chiapello, Marion Leclerc, François Marras\n\n\nParticipants from MaIAGE\nHélène Chiapello, Robert Bossy, Mouhamadou Ba, Olivier Rué, Cédric Midoux\n\n\nPartners (outside MaIAGE)\nCATI BOOM\n\n\nSupervisors during my work\nChristelle Hennequet-Antier, Cédric Midoux, Hélène Chiapello, Éric Dugat-Bony, Julien Tap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time of my arrival, the project’s roadmap included several key steps:\n\nExploring cross-cutting questions in microbial ecology using two statistical approaches:\n\nA hypothesis-driven approach (hypothesis-guided analysis)\n\nA data-driven approach (data-guided analysis)\n\nIntegrating and thoroughly analyzing datasets to understand and formulate new hypotheses about the determinants of microbial community structuring.\n\nMy work primarily focused on conducting exploratory and integrative statistical analyses on 16S metagenomic data. Additionally, I worked on inferring association networks between microbial species.\n\n\n\nExemple of visual results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\alpha-\\)diversity from INRAE Open16S\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\beta-\\)diversity from INRAE Open16S\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPLN network without covariable from INRAE Open16S\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPLN network with the biotope as covariable from INRAE Open16S\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to express my gratitude to the collaborators on this project Christelle Hennequet-Antier, Cédric Midoux, Hélène Chiapello, Éric Dugat-Bony, and Julien Tap for their guidance and expertise.\nI would also like to express my gratitude to everyone in the MaIAGE unit for their warm welcome and kindness.

My participation focused mainly on the analysis of 16S metagenomic data ranging from cleaning, improvement and descriptive analysis to diversity analysis and inference of microbial networks (more information about my work is available in the dedicated project page).\nI then joined the Bilille platform (Bioinformatics, biostatistics and bioanalysis) within the UAR 2014 - US 41 PLBS unit at the University of Lille, working under an RHU-funded research program focused on neurodegenerative diseases. My primary objective is to identify biomarkers for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)."
